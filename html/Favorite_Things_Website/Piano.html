<BR><B><I>PIANO</I></B>
<BR><P>I've been playing the piano since I was in 1st grade. I am a freshman in highschool now, so that means that I played the piano for a total of 9 years so far.</P>

<BR><B><I>ART</I></B>
<BR>
<P>I love drawing and sketching things, but I hate having to color in anything. Do you ever have a problem when you color in something that you drew? I do. Everytime I color it in, it ruins the picture. Here is a picture of one of my sketches...</P>

<BR>
<P>I can't really say that I can dance, but I do dance to Vietnmaese traditional songs for the temple that I volunteer at. I enjoy dancing and teaching the kids choreographies too. Here's a few pictures of the performances that I've been doing ever since I started volunteering at the temple.</P>
