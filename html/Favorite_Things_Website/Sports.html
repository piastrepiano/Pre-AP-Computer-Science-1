</CENTER>
<BR><P>Badminton is a racquet sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles, who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. The birdie is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls used in most racquet sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher top speed, when compared to other racquet sports. Because birdies flight is stubbornly affected by wind, competitive badminton is always played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.</P>

</CENTER>
<BR><P>Badminton to me seems like the easiest sport to play. You just need at least one person to play with. The only skill you need is hand-eye coordination, and it's not easy to be injured because the birdie is too light to hurt you. Badminton is similar to tennis, but it is much more safer in my opinion.</P>
